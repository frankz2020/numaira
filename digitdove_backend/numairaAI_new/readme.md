#### 2. (Crucial) 
Currently, the left-most and the up-most column and row representing the meaning of each cell's value. (Could be set up by user's choice. Automation to be done.) 
#### 3.
This version is for english only. All the document use "billion" or "million" and keep two digits to represent its excel values. (Could be set up according to the users' preference)
